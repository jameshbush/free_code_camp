# free_code_camp

Each Free Code Camp certification requires project work.

I'm completing the projects here on GitHub.
They are accessible at [https://www.jameshbush.com](https://www.jameshbush.com/index.html).

I'm tracking the work at [https://github.com/jameshbush/free_code_camp/projects/1](https://github.com/jameshbush/free_code_camp/projects/1)
